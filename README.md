# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a React Native app for iOS and Android that allows users to create flashcard decks, that they can add cards to and quiz themselves.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-native-app). It uses React Native, Expo, Redux, & React Navigation.

This app is the third of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
